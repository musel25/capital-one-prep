# 04. Test fizzbuzz

Write **tests**, not the implementation. [Original Pybites exercise](https://pybitesplatform.com/bites/test-fizzbuzz/).

This is an offline recreation from the public description. The original code and template are premium and were not available. The API below belongs to this recreation.

## Contract

fizzbuzz(n) accepts any integer, including zero and negatives. Multiples of 15 return FizzBuzz. Other multiples of 3 return Fizz. Other multiples of 5 return Buzz. Return the original integer otherwise.

## Code to test

Import this module as `fizzbuzz`. The judge supplies it automatically.

```python
def fizzbuzz(n):
    if n % 15 == 0:
        return 'FizzBuzz'
    if n % 3 == 0:
        return 'Fizz'
    if n % 5 == 0:
        return 'Buzz'
    return n
```

## Your task

Scroll to **WRITE YOUR TESTS BELOW** in the editor. Replace the placeholder with `test_` functions. Keep the supplied target, runner, and adapter unchanged.

1. All tests must pass against the correct code.
2. Cover at least 90% of executable statements in the supplied target.
3. Detect every supplied faulty variant. A faulty variant is detected when at least one test fails against it.

**Run** checks the baseline and the first two faults. **Submit** checks the baseline and all 5 faults. `SURVIVED` identifies a fault your tests missed. A baseline failure shows the test name and error. Empty suites do not pass.

## Offline pytest support

The supplied runner implements the same small pytest subset used by the OOP course: `pytest.raises` (with `match`), `pytest.mark.parametrize`, function and yield fixtures, `pytest.approx` for numbers, `pytest.fail`, `capsys` / `capfd` for Python output, `monkeypatch`, and `tmp_path`. Standard-library `unittest.mock.patch` also works. Use function-scoped fixtures and top-level test functions. Plugins, async tests, pytest classes with setup hooks, skip/xfail, and advanced fixture scopes are not supported.

The judge uses Python 3.11 and no network. This runner measures statement coverage with Python tracing and uses explicit faulty variants. It does **not** run pytest-cov or mutatest. Its acceptance result is specific to this course.
